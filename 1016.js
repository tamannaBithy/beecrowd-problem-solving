// Two cars (X and Y) leave in the same direction. The car X leaves with a constant speed of 60 km/h and the car Y leaves with a constant speed of 90 km / h.

// In one hour (60 minutes) the car Y can get a distance of 30 kilometers from the X car, in other words, it can get away one kilometer for each 2 minutes.

// Read the distance (in km) and calculate how long it takes (in minutes) for the car Y to take this distance in relation to the other car.

// Input
// The input file contains 1 integer value.
